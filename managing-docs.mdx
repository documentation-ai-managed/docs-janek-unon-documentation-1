## Structuring Pages and Sections

Create a logical hierarchy in your janek unon documentation. Start with top-level sections using H2 headings, then nest subsections with H3 and H4. Use frontmatter for page metadata and maintain consistent naming.

| Element | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Frontmatter | Page title and description | `title: "Page Name"` |
| H2 Headings | Main sections | `## Getting Started` |
| Navigation | Link related pages | `[Link Text](/path/to/page)` |

  ## Endpoints

  Use `fetch` for requests.
  ```
  ```yaml
  title: "Quickstart"
  description: "Set up in 5 minutes."
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Limit pages to 2000 words. Break long content into linked subpages.
</Callout>

## Adding Multimedia and Links

Enhance readability with visuals and navigation. Embed images for screenshots, use `{mermaid}` code blocks for diagrams, and add external links for resources.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Images" icon="image">
    Use the `<Image>` component for responsive visuals.

    ```jsx
    <Image
      src="https://example.com/screenshot.png"
      alt="Dashboard overview"
      width="800"
      height="400"
    />
    ```

    Always include `alt` text for accessibility.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Links" icon="link">
    Internal links use relative paths: `[Docs](/docs/guide)`.

    External links open in new tabs: `[GitHub](https://github.com/janek-unon/docs)`.

    Avoid broken links by testing previews.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Diagrams" icon="activity">
    Create flows with Mermaid code blocks.

    ```mermaid
    graph TD
        A[Draft] --> B[Review]
        B --> C[Publish]
        C --> D[Update]
        D --> B
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
