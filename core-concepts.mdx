## Overview

Janek Unon structures your documentation around workspaces, enabling seamless organization, collaboration, and versioning. You create workspaces to group related docs, invite team members for real-time edits, and track changes with built-in history. These concepts form the foundation for efficient documentation management.

## Workspace Organization

Workspaces act as containers for your documentation projects. You define a workspace with a name, description, and optional metadata to keep projects separate.

### Creating a Workspace

Follow these steps to set up your first workspace:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialize Workspace" icon="plus">
    Use the dashboard to create a new workspace.

    ```javascript
    const workspace = await janek.createWorkspace({
      name: "Project Docs",
      description: "Documentation for Project Alpha"
    });
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Pages" icon="file-text">
    Structure content with pages and subpages.

    ```bash
    janek pages add --workspace "Project Docs" --title "Getting Started"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Permissions" icon="shield">
    Set access levels for members.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Use nested folders within workspaces for hierarchical organization, like `api/reference` or `guides/advanced`.
</Callout>

## Collaboration and Sharing

Invite teammates and external reviewers to collaborate in real-time. Janek Unon supports role-based access: admin, editor, viewer.

      role: "editor"
    });

  </Tab>

## Versioning and History

Janek Unon provides Git-like versioning for every page. You view diffs, revert commits, and branch for experiments.

<CodeGroup tabs="CLI,API">
  ```bash
  # View history
  janek history list --page "Getting Started"

  # Revert to version
  janek history revert --page "Getting Started" --version v1.2
  ```
  ```javascript
  const history = await janek.getPageHistory("Getting Started");
  await janek.revertPage("Getting Started", history[0].id);
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Expandable title="Advanced Versioning Workflow" default-open="false">

  ```mermaid
  graph TD
      A[Draft Changes] --> B[Commit Version]
      B --> C[Review Diff]
      C --> D{Approved?}
      D -- Yes --> E[Publish]
      D -- No --> A
  ```

  Integrate with CI/CD by exporting history as JSON for audits.
